AR / VR Virtual Building Tour Application
Project Overview

This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)–based virtual building tour application developed as part of a university AR/VR coursework project. The application delivers an immersive experience by combining 360° AR/VR camera footage, interactive VR scenes, 3D environments, animations, and web-based VR technologies.

Real-world environments were captured using an AR/VR (360°) camera, processed using professional media editing tools, and then integrated into interactive VR scenes accessible through a web browser.

Academic Context

This project was completed to meet university academic requirements for AR and VR development modules, focusing on:

Practical AR/VR implementation

360° camera usage and immersive content creation

Integration of videos, animations, and 3D assets

Web-based VR development

Combining creative media production with software engineering

Key Features

Application Functionality
VR Scenes

Each building*.html file represents a separate VR environment, combining:

360° video backgrounds captured using an AR/VR camera

3D objects and visual elements

Camera controls and navigation

Interactive and immersive viewing experience

Environment Configuration

The environment.js file manages:

Lighting and sky presets

Camera behavior

Scene atmosphere and environment consistency

Media Integration

Real-world locations captured using a 360° AR/VR camera

Post-processed and edited in Adobe tools

Integrated as video textures and scene backgrounds

Optimized for browser-based VR rendering

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites

Python installed

Modern web browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended)
